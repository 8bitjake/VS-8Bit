Sets a specific property of a character, stage element,
the camera, etc.

Value 1: The property to set.
	 Properties follow this syntax: object.property
	 For example, "gf.x" will return Girlfriend's X position.
Value 2: The new value of the property.
I recommend looking through the source of your
stage/FNF to find the property and object names.
